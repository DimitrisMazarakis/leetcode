Intuition
First of all I thought to solve it without converting it in to a string by seperating the digits but this had more complexity. I thought that you need to put a mirror in the center of the number and see if they match the reflactions.

Approach
So the first for loop starts with the first digit of the number and ends with the last digit of tyhe half nuimber length because as I said we put a mirror in the center of the number to seperate in to halfs. And for its character it checks if it the same with the one form the mirror {y.length() - 1 - i} and if it is not then it definetelly not a palindrome number

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n)

Space complexity:
O(n)

Code
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        String y = String.valueOf(x);
        for (int i = 0; i < y.length() / 2; i++) {
            if (y.charAt(i) != y.charAt(y.length() - 1 - i)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
